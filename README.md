# Text_detection_and_recognition
#Overview 
Since deep-learning had its rebirth with AlexNet success, it has been been used
to solve multiple problems like image classification, object detection, or image
segmentation. The text detection and recognition models are used by everyone on
day to day basis now, but this problem still serves as a classic problem for which
deep learning is the only current solution which can be used in the real world. Many
deep learning architectures have been tested for this problem such as Recurrent
Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM, Connectionist Temporal Classification,
etc. Further with people finding new ways to supplement the training data, the
models are able to generalize better resulting in better accuracy, even finding text
in arbitrary shapes in the images.

#setup
if one would like to run the dection file we would need to download the IDCAR 2015 datset both training and testing and secondly the MJSynth dataset for training recognition

#Demo
if one would like to run the demo files they simly need to dowload all the file and folders in this repo
note: the all the file would be saved in dump folder after the detection is done on images
